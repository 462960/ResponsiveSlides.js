# AdaptiveSlides.js 
### Adaptive slideshow plugin that weights just ~1kb

 - Licensed under the MIT license.

[AdaptiveSlides.js](http://adaptiveslides.viljamis.com/) is a tiny jQuery plugin that automatically creates adaptive slideshow using images inside a container. It work with wide range of browsers including all IE versions from IE6 and up. It also adds css max-width support for IE6 and other browsers that don't natively support it. Only dependency is [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and that all the images are same size.

Biggest difference to other responsive slideshow plugins is the file size (~1kb minified and gzipped) + that this one doesn't try to do everything. AdaptiveSlides.js has basically only two different modes: Either it just automatically fades the images, or operates as an adaptive image container with pagination to navigate/fade between slides.
